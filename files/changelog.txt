Release v1.2.9
* Update to ModuleManager 2.8.0 for KSP 1.3 compatibility
* Update to target .NET 3.5, as a KSP mod is supposed to (it was targeting 4.5.2 before)


Release v1.2.8
* Make ModuleCrewIndicator friendlier to modders, so they can easily add indicator colors for new (modded) kerbal types. (Thanks to smokytehbear for nudging me into this.)
* Add "main" renderer type for ModuleControllableEmissive, so it's possible to change the diffuse color of a mesh.


Release v1.2.7
* Add crew indicators to the Mk3 cockpit and Mk3 crew cabin. (Thanks to SchwinnTropius for the suggestion, and some time-saving numbers.)
* Add compatibility patch for KIS. (Thanks to Enceos for the suggestion, and for finding the right syntax to use.)

* Update MPL science lab crew indicators to use hasCrewEffect().


Release v1.2.6, a.k.a. "The Enceos Edition"
* Enable IndicatorLights to work with "tint" color on Unity shaders, not just "emissive" color. (Thanks to Enceos for the suggestion.)
* Update the color-parsing logic to allow specifying alpha values in config, in addition to RGB. (Thanks to Enceos for the suggestion.)
* Enable resource indicators to specify that they show the *parent* part's resource contents. (Thanks to Enceos for the suggestion.)

Release v1.2.5
* Add "unknown" default color (magenta! but configurable), and enable crew indicators to use that for new kerbal types. (Thanks to mikerl for the suggestion.)
* Cover up a dummy stock "indicator" on the Z4K battery that was causing player confusion. (Thanks to Fwiffo for the suggestion.)
* Add situation() toggle syntax, with example config. (Thanks to steedcrugeon for the feature idea.)
* Fix a careless bug that broke the 3-argument form of the pulsate() syntax.

* Breaking change to ModuleBooleanIndicator to use the new toggle syntax.
* Added new "if()" color source syntax. (Thanks to Fwiffo for suggesting.)
* ModuleCustomBlink now has a field that can choose where to show its UI (editor, flight, both, neither). Thanks to Fwiffo for suggesting.
* Modified BL-01 light's config so that its "blink enabled/disabled?" UI is only shown in the editor.
* ModuleScienceAvailabilityIndicator can now specify experiment ID and "low science" color. (Thanks to Fwiffo for suggesting.)

Release v1.2, a.k.a. "The Antennas Edition"
* Add indicators to all antennas, with a random modem-like flicker while transmitting data. Faster transmitters = faster flicker.
* Fix a bug that caused IndicatorLights-enabled meshes to not work with the thermal overlay (Science Jr. was especially bad).

Release v1.0, a.k.a. "The 'Why Wait Any Longer' Edition"
* Add phase control to blinking lights.
* Implemented ModuleIndirectToggleIndicator (not yet used for anything).
* Decided to stop pretending this is a "pre-release".  :-)


Pre-release v0.11, a.k.a. "The Prospector's Edition"
* Add an indicator light to the orbital survey scanner.
* Add an indicator to the surface scanner.
* (Moddability) Extend ColorSource syntax to allow field references within a module.


Pre-release v0.10.1
* Minor bugfix for science display on goo canister and Science Jr.
* Fix a potential NRE bug in ModuleControllableEmissive.


Pre-release v0.10, a.k.a. "The Science Edition"
* Added indicators to all science instruments.
* Added some TextureReplacer config to avoid an exception in the log. Thanks to Gaiiden in the KSP forums for tracking down both the problem and the solution!


Pre-release v0.9.1, a.k.a. "The Kerbart Edition"
* Fixed all "toggle" actions so that they follow action group status. In other words, when you turn on "Lights" group, everything you've added to that group will turn on, regardless of whether it was on already.
* Tweaked animation logic so that blink speed will follow game-time rather than real-world time when in physics warp (i.e. blinks faster when time passes faster).
* Fixed a bug in which saving and then re-loading a custom-colored light (e.g. the BL-01) results in color-slider values with long, ugly decimals.
* Thanks to Kerbart in the KSP forums for calling out all of the above!
* ...Oh, and updated ModuleManager to latest version.


Pre-release v0.9
* Refactor resource indicators for greater configurability.
* Add crew indicators to science lab, with custom animations.
* Add crew indicator to Mk1 cockpit.
* Add science data animation to Science Jr. materials bay.
* Provide an "error" animation color to help modders debug config problems.
* Breaking change for players: Save games will run just fine, but indicators on batteries for ships in flight or previously saved in the editor won't work right.
* Breaking change for modders: if you've patched your parts to show resource level (e.g. for batteries), you'll need to update your config.


Pre-release v0.8, a.k.a. "The ISRU Edition"
* Add indicators to the large and small ISRU units.
* Add crew indicators to the Mk2 cockpit and Mk2 crew cabin.
* Made the default on/off status of crew indicator lights configurable.


Pre-release v0.7.1
* Fix bug introduced in 0.7 that broke lots of indicators.
* Add crew indicator to cupola.


Pre-release v0.7, a.k.a. "The Crew Edition"
* Add crew occupancy indicators to various crewed modules.
* BROKEN!  Do not use this version.


Pre-release v0.6
* Added blinking option to BL-01 indicator light.
* Docking port indicators now blink when docking field is engaging/disengaging.
* Significant internal refactoring for greatly increased flexibility. Blinking now addable to anything via ModuleManager config.
* Likely breaking change for players: Doesn't break save games. However, any prior BL-01 lights or docking port indicators (either in flight, or in saved ships) won't work right


Pre-release v0.5, a.k.a. "The Docking Port Edition"
* Added status indicators to small, medium, and large docking ports, with a PartModule that works for any docking port.
* Slightly adjusted the position of the indicator on the Z400 battery.
* Significant re-architecture of internal controller logic. No effect on players, but a potential breaking change to any modders working with ModuleToggleLED.


Pre-release v0.4, a.k.a. "The Reaction Wheel Edition"
* Added status indicators for reaction wheels.
* Made the default colors of all indicators user-configurable


Pre-release v0.3, a.k.a. "The Battery Edition"
* Add charge indicator lights to batteries, with a PartModule that works for any resource container
