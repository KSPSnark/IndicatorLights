// Sample config to have a part that shows the resource level of its *parent* part.
// We'll use ModuleManager to clone the BL-01 standalone indicator light and give
// it new behavior.
//
// If you're wondering "hey, this is cool, why is this just an example, rather than
// being an actual part?", it's because there's still a sizable chunk of work left
// to do to make this into a polished, shippable product. First, there would need to
// be some sort of UI available to pick which resource to show. Second, a real standalone
// part really ought to have a model of its own, rather than being an exact visual copy
// of the BL-01 light. Someday I may make something like this as an actual part for
// IndicatorLights that gets installed by default, but for now it's just a sample.
