## What it does

Adds various helpful LED "indicators" to enhance your ships.  Broadly speaking, these fall into two categories:

 * **Standalone parts:**  radially attachable LED lights with customizable colors, which can be toggled on/off with action groups.
 * **Enhancements to existing parts:**  add LEDs to stock parts to provide a visible, automatic indication of part status (such as whether a fuel cell is on or off).
 
 For details (either as a player or as a modder), please see the **[IndicatorLights wiki](https://github.com/KSPSnark/IndicatorLights/wiki)**.

 
## How to install

Unzip the contents of "GameData" to your GameData folder, same as with most mods. (Note, includes ModuleManager.)


## It's not done yet!
